                            INDIRECTLY MARKET TO PATIENTS BY DIRECTLY INFLUENCING THEIR PRESCRIBERS<br />

                            Visiatric helps grow privately owned independent pharmacies through our specialized relationship marketing program.<br />
                            In an era of health care reform, it is vital to convince both consumers and prescribers that your neighborhood drugstore is not a relic of the past, but instead plays a significant role in containing costs and improving patient outcomes.<br />
                            Chain pharmacies relentlessly market and advertise on a national level, generating strong brand name recognition for their company. Visiatric offers your pharmacy the opportunity to improve your marketing power and to better compete with the larger chain retailers. As an independent pharmacy, you DO have a powerful marketing advantage that has been thus far overlooked.<br />
                            Beat the national retailers locally. Advertise more efficiently and in ways that the competition cannot by providing a service that improves healthcare throughout your community.

                    VISIATRIC PROVIDES MEDICATIONS CONSULTATIONS FOR PRESCRIBERS<br />
                    As medical professionals, we know that most pharmaceutical representatives have a very limited understanding of the medical field if any.
                    So why do we trust what they say? Well for starters, they come bearing gifts and free drug samples. Plus, most pharmaceutical sales representatives are very friendly, personable, and confident.
                    Pharmaceutical Representatives are hired to act as talented persuaders. They are not required to disclose all current or unbiased information about their products.
                    “Pharmaceutical Representatives are not evil, but they are time-consuming and serve interests that often are at odds with those of our patients.  To spend time with reps in a manner that preserves professional integrity would require both refusing to accept their gifts and spending a great deal of valuable time double-checking their information.”- Howard Brody, MD, PhD
                    Over the past two decades, legal claims against the pharmaceutical industry have included Medicare and Medicaid fraud, off-label promotion, and inadequate manufacturing practices. In Fact, every major company selling antipsychotics has either settled recent government cases (False Claims Act) for hundreds of millions of dollars or is under investigation for healthcare fraud and facing charges for illegal marketing.
                    The sad truth is that prescription drugs are now the 4th leading cause of death in the United States and as medical professionals, we should not be taking this lightly. Obviously much of the blame falls on the pharmaceutical companies for their illegal marketing practices, but as healthcare experts, aren’t we also at fault for accepting their free samples and allowing ourselves to be fooled by their aggressive salesmen? Isn’t it our duty to question their product’s safety and efficacy; to take the time to evaluate the medication thoroughly before risking the health of our trusting patients?
                    Who has the time to do all of that? Working as a physician and running a practice is time consuming and costly. In order to ensure that your business runs smoothly and stays profitable, you must see patients and not spend time meeting with drug reps and researching medications.
                    Visiatric LLC has developed a consulting service to solve this issue. Through Visiatric LLC, a PharmD is provided to represent your practice and meet with your pharmaceutical representatives on your behalf. After discussing their solicited medication, our PharmD then researches and writes a report/presentation evaluating the clinical trials and pharmacoeconomics of the medication. All evaluations are developed using evidence-based medicine only.
                    Our pharmaceutical experts will provide you with up-to-date pharmaceutical facts while simultaneously freeing up your waiting room and allowing you to see more patients. Through Visiatric LLC, you can reassure your patients that your prescribing habits are not influenced by Big Pharma and that they will be receiving the safest and most cost-effective treatments available, not the best promoted.
